This is completely a hack.  There are no tests.  It's really only half
sketched out.  But it does work ... mostly.  Really I just got enough of
it done so that my test programs would run.

Known missing parts include compiling for loops (they parse fine, I just
haven't reworked the compiler to put them in.)  And there are probably
numerous "primitives" that I just haven't added yet.  Also I think GOSUB
and RETURN are unimplemented.
